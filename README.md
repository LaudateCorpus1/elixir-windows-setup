elixir-windows-setup
====================

This installer, part of the Elixir on Windows Google Summer of Code 2014 project, is a work in progress.  Jordan Russell's [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) makes it possible, and if you download a copy of the compiler, you can try the installer out.
